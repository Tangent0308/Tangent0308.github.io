My name is Tan Yue, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the School of Information Sciences and Technology, Peking University. I'm passionate about multimodal research and am currently engaged in relevant studies, though I consider myself a novice in this field. I'm enthusiastic about exploring the integration of different data modalities and its potential applications. I'm looking forward to learning and growing in this field.
